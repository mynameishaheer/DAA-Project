### Codes used in experiment for testing
 - Brute Force Algorithm
 - Brute Force with Pruning Algorithm
 - Backtracking Algorithm

These algorithms have been altered to show only how long it takes to execute each algorithm in milliseconds
The print statements have been factored out to show more accurate computational time taken

NOTE: All source links have been provided in the codes themselves
